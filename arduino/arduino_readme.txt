Installing the lobraries:

The correct location for the user's libraries is the libraries subfolder of the sketchbook folder. The sketchbook folder location is set in the Arduino IDE at File > Preferences > Sketchbook location.
e.g.: /home/robbert/snap/arduino/current/Arduino

cp lib.tar.gz  /home/robbert/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/libraries
cd /home/robbert/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/libraries
tar -xf lib.tar
